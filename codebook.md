# Analysis of UCI HAR Dataset
### Louis Fernandes
This project was completed to fulfill Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data", course project number two on January 31st, 2016. Results can be found at [https://github.com/louisfern/wearableCleaning](https://github.com/louisfern/wearableCleaning).

## Important files:
1. README.md: This file, and a quick guide to the project.
2. `run_analysis.R`: The code which performs data loading and manipulation.
3. `codebook.md`: The procedures by which data were acquired and manipulated, as well as a listing of units and other data-centric information.

## `codebook.md` TL;DR
- Data were acquired from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) via [Coursera](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
- Analysis was performed in R with the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages.
- Input data were several tables; output data is a single [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) table. 

**_Happy analyzing!_**
